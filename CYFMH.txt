Can you hear the silence?
Can you see the dark?
Can you fix the broken?
Can you feel, can you feel my heart?

What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean, ayy
